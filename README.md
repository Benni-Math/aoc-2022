# Advent of Code 2022

**Warning**: Only done with the first 7 days so far.

I'll be trying to solve some of the AOC 2022 problems.

To run, get you're AoC 2022 inputs and place them in a directory name `inputs/` in the root of this project. The inputs must be named '01.txt', '02.txt', and so on until '25.txt'. Then, just run `poetry run aoc-2022` in the command line and the outputs for each programming language will be created in the `outputs/` directory.

(You might need to run `poetry install`).

For details on running specific languages, go to their directories.

## Up Next

 - Incorporate C solutions
 - Upgrade `scripts` (split into modules and add individual run scripts)

## Requirements

To run everything, you'll need the following:

 - Poetry & Python 3.11 (or higher)
    - 3.10 needed for `match-case` statements
 - Typescript 4.9.4^ & Node v16 (ES2022)
    - ES2022 support needed for `String.prototype.replaceAll()` 
 - Cargo & Rust 1.66
 - Elixir/Mix 1.14.2 & Erlang/OTP 25
