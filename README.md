# Advent of Code 2022

I'll be trying to solve some of the AOC 2022 problems.

To run, get you're AoC 2022 inputs and place them in a directory name `inputs/` in the root of this project. The inputs must be named '01.txt', '02.txt', and so on until '25.txt'. Then, just run `python run_all.py` in the command line and the outputs for each programming language will be created in the `outputs/` directory.

## Requirements

To run everything, you'll need the following:

 - Python 3.10 (or higher)
    - 3.10 needed for `match-case` statements
 - Typescript 4.9.4^ & Node v16 (ES2022)
    - ES2022 support needed for `String.prototype.replaceAll()` 
 - Rust/Cargo 1.66
 - Elixir/Mix 1.14.2 and Erlang/OTP 25
